                    <td>Single-Use Plastic Free School Program</td>
                    <td>In 2021, we have developed and implemented together with our partners from Making Oceans Plastic Free a pilot program – Single-Use Plastic Free School. We were working together with 3 local educational departments in Malang, Mataram and West Lombok regencies, reaching 9 elementary schools and their grade 4-6 students. In 2022, we updated the program (based on the teachers’ feedback) and implemented it in another 5 elementary schools in Mataram and West Lombok regencies.
                    Indonesia has seen a sharp increase in plastic pollution over the past years, exposing people to a large number of health and economic risks. There are risks resulting from ingesting microplastics with increasingly contaminated marine food, risks from negative effects on the fishery sector, and also the tourism industry. Being the fourth most populous country with 40% of plastic waste ending up in the ocean, the negative impact goes far beyond local risks: Indonesia is the world’s second-largest source of marine plastic pollution significantly contributing to the global marine litter crisis.
                    <br>We identified effective opportunities to change plastic habits based on environmental education activities for school children. We used the training of teachers to attain sustainable impact and multiplier effects. School children as a target group offered the opportunity for easier and more effective results due to early intervention principles. Furthermore, results from the interventions yield benefits for lifelong positive impacts.

                    In the Single-Use Plastic Free School program, we support schools and teachers in helping school children to change their plastic habits with easy, fun, and interactive eco-education activities spread into 12 lessons.
                    
                    Based on the impact surveys, the school children increased awareness of plastic pollution risks, learned about alternative solutions, and were empowered to change their plastic habits effectively. Part of the program is eco-friendly rewards such as refillable water bottles, water filters, reusable Tasini keychain/tote bags, and educational comic books. 
                    
                    The Single-Use Plastic Free Schools pilot program (2021) was funded by the ‘Rethinking Plastics – Circular Economy Solutions to Marine Litter’ project of the European Union and the German Government.

                    <td>In 2022, we have developed together with our partners from Plastic Bank Indonesia a pilot program – Ocean Stewards. The program is designed for elementary school students in Bali, Lombok, Surabaya, and Jakarta. It consists of 12 lessons for grades 1-3 and 12 lessons for grades 4-6.

                        The purpose of this project is to educate future generations on how to reduce single-use plastic consumption and develop plastic recycling habits, starting from home, to protect the environment and our ocean.
                        
                        The sustainability of the project is secured by providing access to recycling infrastructure in the schools for students, families, teachers, and surrounding communities. By donating their recyclable plastic waste they can contribute to increasing the plastic recycling rate, and stop ocean plastic.
                        
                        The Ocean Stewards program is a pilot project for schools in Indonesia by Plastic Bank in partnership with Alliance to End Plastic Waste. It is planned to be adopted by Plastic Bank branches in the Philippines, Thailand, Egypt, and Brazil.</td>

                    <td>Since July 2019, the Zero Waste School Program has been adopted by individual educators and schools across Indonesia – from North Sumatra to Aceh, Jambi, South Sumatra, Central Sulawesi, West Java, Central Java, East Java, North Maluku, Lombok, and Bali.

                        The topics of the program include problems posed by plastic waste and microplastic to the environment and marine life, taking action to reduce their use of single-use plastic by switching to reusable bags and water bottles, exploring waste separation and bio decomposition of organic waste versus inorganic waste, and linking to local waste banks.
                        
                        Teachers indicated in the post-activity surveys that the Zero Waste School Program is easy to implement and the children are enthusiastic and inspired by the content and format. They also pointed out that the curriculum enhanced their own knowledge and supported them to become greener educators.
                        
                        Easy-to-carry reusable Tasini bags have been distributed to the participants who have completed the first stage of the program enabling them to switch from single-use plastic bags. The other eco-friendly rewards include Zero Waste Lunch Kits and water filters.</td>

        <h2>B. TRAINING OF TEACHERS</h2>
        <p>
            Teachers are at the heart of our quest to inspire the children and communities to live more sustainably. We believe that training local teachers is the most effective way to scale up awareness of environmental topics and achieve behavioral change in the schoolchildren and the wider population. We use the training of teachers to attain sustainable impact and multiplier effects.
